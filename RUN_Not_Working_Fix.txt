You're not in the correct directory: Ensure that you're in the root directory of your project where the venv folder is located.

Incorrect path or typo: The script might be in the wrong directory, or the name may be incorrect.

Let's walk through the steps to troubleshoot this:

Steps to Fix:
Navigate to the correct directory:
Make sure you are in the correct directory where your virtual environment (venv) folder exists. You can navigate there by running the following command:

powershell
Copier
Modifier
cd C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\GeeksInstitu\GeeksALMA
Verify the virtual environment folder:
Check if the venv folder exists in your project directory by running:

powershell
Copier
Modifier
dir
This should show a list of files and directories. Ensure that the venv folder is listed.

Check the activate script:
Once you're sure you're in the right directory, try running:

powershell
Copier
Modifier
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
If it still doesn’t work, check if the Activate.ps1 file exists by navigating to the folder and verifying:

powershell
Copier
Modifier
dir .\venv\Scripts\
Look for Activate.ps1 in the output.

If it’s still not working:
If the virtual environment was not created properly, you might want to recreate it. To do so, follow these steps:

Delete the existing venv folder (if it's not needed anymore).

Create a new virtual environment:

powershell
Copier
Modifier
python -m venv venv
Activate it again:

powershell
Copier
Modifier
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
