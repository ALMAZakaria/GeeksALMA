build for me the following project using postgres for database" 📦 Project: Book Review API A RESTful API to manage books and reviews where: Users can add books and write reviews. Admins can delete books/reviews and manage users. 🧱 Features Overview Feature Description Authentication JWT-based login/signup system Roles admin and user CRUD: Books Create, Read, Update, Delete CRUD: Reviews Users can create/update/delete only their own Users Management Admins can delete users or list all users Middleware JWT token verification, role-based access Database SQLite with SQLAlchemy (can be extended to PostgreSQL/MySQL) Validation Pydantic models for input validation 🗃 Project Structure Example pgsqlCopyEditbook_review_api/ │ ├── app/ │ ├── main.py │ ├── database.py │ ├── models.py │ ├── schemas.py │ ├── crud.py │ ├── auth.py │ ├── middleware.py │ └── dependencies.py │ └── requirements.txt  📑 Example Endpoints Method Endpoint Access Description POST /signup Public Register new user POST /login Public Get JWT token POST /books Auth Add new book GET /books Public List all books PUT /books/{id} Auth (owner/admin) Update book DELETE /books/{id} Admin Delete book POST /books/{book_id}/review Auth Add review GET /books/{book_id}/reviews Public Get reviews DELETE /users/{user_id} Admin Delete a user 🔐 Authentication & Roles JWT token required for all protected routes Middleware to: Validate JWT Attach user to the request Check if the user has admin role if needed 🛠 Technologies Used FastAPI SQLAlchemy….. Pydantic JWT via python-jose Passlib for password hashing ✅ Sample Middleware pythonCopyEditfrom fastapi import Request, HTTPException from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware from jose import jwt, JWTError SECRET_KEY = "your-secret" ALGORITHM = "HS256" class AuthMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware): async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next): if request.url.path.startswith("/login") or request.url.path.startswith("/signup"): return await call_next(request) token = request.headers.get("Authorization") if not token: raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="No auth token") try: payload = jwt.decode(token.split(" ")[1], SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM]) request.state.user = payload except JWTError: raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid token") return await call_next(request)  Middleware in FastAPI In FastAPI, middleware is a way to execute custom logic before or after each request. You can use it to handle things like authentication, logging, request transformation, rate limiting, etc. 🔧 What Is Middleware in FastAPI? Middleware in FastAPI is a class that intercepts all HTTP requests and responses. It can: Inspect or modify the request before it reaches your endpoint. Inspect or modify the response before it is returned to the client. ✅ Syntax: Basic Middleware Structure You can define a middleware by subclassing BaseHTTPMiddleware from starlette.middleware.base. pythonCopyEditfrom starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware from fastapi import Request class MyMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware): async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next): # 👉 Code BEFORE the request reaches the route response = await call_next(request) # 👉 Code AFTER the response is generated return response Then you add the middleware to your FastAPI app: pythonCopyEditfrom fastapi import FastAPI from mymiddleware import MyMiddleware app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(MyMiddleware)  🔐 Example: Auth Middleware with JWT Let’s say you want to authenticate users using a Bearer token in the Authorization header. pythonCopyEditfrom fastapi import Request, HTTPException from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware from jose import jwt, JWTError SECRET_KEY = "your-secret" ALGORITHM = "HS256" class AuthMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware): async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next): public_paths = ["/login", "/signup", "/docs", "/openapi.json"] if any(request.url.path.startswith(path) for path in public_paths): return await call_next(request) token = request.headers.get("Authorization") if not token: raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="No auth token provided") try: scheme, jwt_token = token.split() if scheme.lower() != "bearer": raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid token scheme") payload = jwt.decode(jwt_token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM]) request.state.user = payload # 👈 store the user in the request except (JWTError, ValueError): raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid or expired token") return await call_next(request)  🎯 How to Use the Authenticated User In your route: pythonCopyEditfrom fastapi import Request, Depends, HTTPException def get_current_user(request: Request): if not hasattr(request.state, "user"): raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="User not authenticated") return request.state.user @app.get("/me") def read_me(user=Depends(get_current_user)): return {"user": user}  🧠 Why Use Middleware? Use Case Should You Use Middleware? JWT Authentication ✅ Yes Rate Limiting ✅ Yes Logging/Monitoring ✅ Yes Database Session Handling ❌ Better with Depends CORS ❌ Use built-in middleware 🧪 Tips Middleware runs before dependencies, so it’s good for authentication headers. Use request.state to pass data downstream to routes and dependencies. Avoid heavy computation in middleware, it affects all routes."
This is an excellent project idea, Zakaria! Given your strong problem-solving skills and expertise in building REST APIs with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, you're well-equipped to bring this idea to life.

I can certainly help you structure and build out the different components step by step. Since you want PostgreSQL as the database instead of SQLite, we’ll use SQLAlchemy with a PostgreSQL connection.

🚀 Project Plan
We'll break the project down into key components:

1-Setting Up PostgreSQL & SQLAlchemy

2-Defining Models & Schemas

3-Implementing Authentication & JWT Handling

4-Building CRUD Operations for Books & Reviews

5-Creating Middleware for Role-Based Access

6-Handling User Management for Admins

7-Testing & Debugging
